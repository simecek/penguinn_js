# penguinn_js

My first TensorflowJS app. The input is 200bp string of letters A, C, T and G. The output is a probability of G4 complex. The model was developed by my colleagues.

This version is now **obsolete**, since *Penguinn JS* now lives in the [gh-pages](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/penguinn/tree/gh-pages) branch of [Penguinn](https://github.com/ML-Bioinfo-CEITEC/penguinn) GitHub repo.
